# Quick Start

This section provides a fast and easy guide to getting the `dj-notification-api` package up and running in your Django project. Follow the steps below to quickly set up the package and start creating notifications.

## 1. Install the Package

**Option 1: Using `pip` (Recommended)**

Install the package via pip:

```bash
$ pip install dj-notification-api
```

**Option 2: Using `poetry`**

If you're using Poetry, add the package with:

```bash
$ poetry add dj-notification-api
```

**Option 3: Using `pipenv`**

```bash
$ pipenv install dj-notification-api
```

## 2. Add to Installed Apps

Once installed,  ensure that both `rest_framework` and `django_notification` are added to the `INSTALLED_APPS` in your Django `settings.py` file::

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # ...
    "rest_framework",  # Required for API support

    "django_notification",
    # ...
]
```

## 3. (Optional) Configure API Filters

To enable filtering of notifications through the API, include `django_filters` in your `INSTALLED_APPS` and configure the filter settings.

Add `django_filters` to your `INSTALLED_APPS`:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # ...
    "django_filters",
    # ...
]
```

Then, set the filter class configuration in your `settings.py`:
```python
DJANGO_NOTIFICATION_API_FILTERSET_CLASS = "django_notification.api.filters.notification_filter.NotificationFilter"
```

## 4. Apply Migrations

Run the following command to apply the necessary migrations:
```shell
python manage.py migrate
```

## 5. Add Notification API URLs

Include the notification API routes in your projectâ€™s `urls.py` file:
```python
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    # ...
    path("notification/", include("django_notification.api.routers.notification")),
    # ...
]
```

## 6. Create Notifications

To create notifications and use them in your project, use the `Notification` model from the `django_notification` package. The `create_notification` method allows you to generate notifications dynamically based on various events in your application.

### Example:

```python
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
from django_notification.models.notification import Notification
from django_notification.models.helper.enums.status_choices import NotificationStatus

# Define the actor and recipients
actor = User.objects.get(username="admin")
recipient = User.objects.get(username="john_doe")

# Create a new notification
Notification.objects.create_notification(
    verb="Logged in to Admin panel",
    actor=actor,
    recipients=[recipient],
    description="User logged in to admin area.",
    status=NotificationStatus.INFO,
    public=True,
    link="https://example.com/admin/dashboard",
    is_sent=True,
)
```

**Arguments:**

- **verb** (`str`): A description of the action (e.g., "Logged in", "Created an item").
- **actor** (`Model`): The model instance that performs the action (e.g., user, system).
- **description** (`Optional[str]`): Optional additional information.
- **recipients** (`Optional[Union[UserModel, QuerySet, List[UserModel]]]`): One or more users who will receive the notification.
- **groups** (`Optional[Union[Group, QuerySet, List[Group]]]`): Optional user groups who will receive the notification.
- **status** (`Optional[str]`): Notification status (default is `NotificationStatus.INFO`).
- **public** (`bool`): Whether the notification is public (default is `True`).
- **target** (`Optional[Model]`): Optional target object related to the notification.
- **action_object** (`Optional[Model]`): Optional object that is the focus of the action.
- **link** (`Optional[str]`): Optional URL link related to the notification.
- **is_sent** (`bool`): Marks whether the notification is sent (default is `False`).
- **data** (`Optional[Dict]`): Optional additional data in dictionary format (JSON Field).

**Note**: The `description` field is used as the title of the notification, and it will be displayed with a time-relative format, such as: `User logged in to admin area a minute ago.`

If the `description` is not provided, a title will be automatically generated based on several fields like the `actor`, `verb`, and other relevant fields (e.g., target or action object).


### 7. Verify Notifications

Once notifications are created, they can be managed through the API endpoints. To test and verify the creation, make a request to the relevant endpoint, for example:

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/notification/notifications/
```
This will return a list of notifications created for the authenticated user.


With the setup complete, the `django_notification` is ready for use in your project. For further customizations and settings, refer to the [API Guide](#api-guide) and [Settings](#settings) sections.

# API Guide

This section provides a detailed overview of the Django Notification API, allowing users to manage notifications efficiently. The API exposes two main endpoints:

1. **notification/notifications/**:

   - Lists all unseen notifications.
   - Retrieves a single unseen notification.
   - Marks all notifications as seen (action: `mark_all_as_seen`).

2. **notification/activities/**:

   - Lists all seen notifications.
   - Retrieves a single seen notification.
   - Soft deletes all seen notifications (action: `clear_activities`).
   - Soft deletes a single seen notification (action: `clear_notification`).
   - For Admins:
     - Hard deletes all seen notifications (action: `delete_activities`).
     - Hard deletes a single seen notification (action: `delete_notification`).

## Notifications API

The `notification/notifications/` endpoint provides the following features:

- **List unseen notifications**:
  Fetches all unseen notifications for the authenticated user. Controlled by the `DJANGO_NOTIFICATION_API_ALLOW_LIST` setting.

- **Retrieve a notification**:
  Retrieves a specific unseen notification by its ID and automatically marks it as seen. Controlled by the `DJANGO_NOTIFICATION_API_ALLOW_RETRIEVE` setting.

- **Mark all as seen**:
  Marks all unseen notifications for the user as seen. Once marked, they move to the `activities` endpoint.

## Activities API

The `notification/activities/` endpoint offers these features:

- **List seen notifications**:
  Lists all seen notifications for the authenticated user. Controlled by the `DJANGO_NOTIFICATION_API_ALLOW_LIST` setting.

- **Retrieve a seen notification**:
  Fetches a specific seen notification by its ID. Controlled by the `DJANGO_NOTIFICATION_API_ALLOW_RETRIEVE` setting.

- **Clear activities (Soft delete)**:
  Soft deletes all seen notifications, removing them from view without permanent deletion. Controlled by the `DJANGO_NOTIFICATION_API_INCLUDE_SOFT_DELETE` setting.

- **Clear a single notification (Soft delete)**:
  Soft deletes a specific seen notification by its ID.

- **Delete activities (Hard delete)**:
  Permanently deletes all seen notifications for `ADMIN` users. Controlled by the `DJANGO_NOTIFICATION_API_INCLUDE_HARD_DELETE` setting.

- **Delete a single notification (Hard delete)**:
  Permanently deletes a specific seen notification by its ID (only for `ADMIN` users).

## Example Responses

Here are some examples of responses for each action:

### List notifications with full details:

```http
GET /notification/notifications/

Response:
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

"results": [
    {
        "id": 1,
        "title": "User logged in to the Admin panel a minute ago",
        "recipient": [
            {
                "username": "user",

```
**Note**: you can exclude Any fields with a `null` value in the response output by adding this config in your `settings.py`:
```python
DJANGO_NOTIFICATION_SERIALIZER_EXCLUDE_NULL_FIELDS = True
```

## Throttling

The API includes a built-in throttling mechanism that limits the number of requests a user can make based on their role. You can customize these throttle limits in the settings file.

To specify the throttle rates for authenticated users and staff members, add the following in your settings:

```python
DJANGO_NOTIFICATION_AUTHENTICATED_USER_THROTTLE_RATE = "100/day"
DJANGO_NOTIFICATION_STAFF_USER_THROTTLE_RATE = "60/minute"
```
These settings limit the number of requests users can make within a given timeframe.

**Note:** You can define custom throttle classes and reference them in your settings.

## Filtering, Ordering, and Search

The API supports filtering, ordering, and searching of notifications. A filter class can be applied optionally, allowing users to narrow down results.

### Options include:

- **Filtering**: By default, the filtering feature is not included. If you want to use this, you need to add `django_filters` to your `INSTALLED_APPS` and provide the path to the `NotificationFilter` class (`"django_notification.api.filters.notification_filter.NotificationFilter"`). Alternatively, you can use a custom filter class if needed.

  - **Note**: For more clarification, refer to the `DJANGO_NOTIFICATION_API_FILTERSET_CLASS` in the [Settings](#settings) section.

- **Ordering**: Results can be ordered by fields such as `id`, `timestamp`, or `public`.

- **Search**: You can search fields like `verb` and `description`.

These fields can be customized by adjusting the related configurations in your Django settings.

## Pagination

The API supports limit-offset pagination, with configurable minimum, maximum, and default page size limits. This controls the number of results returned per page.

## Permissions

The base permission for all endpoints is `IsAuthenticated`, meaning users must be logged in to access the API. You can extend this by creating custom permission classes to implement more specific access control.

For instance, you can allow only specific user roles to perform certain actions.

## Parser Classes

The API supports multiple parser classes that control how data is processed. The default parsers include:

- `JSONParser`
- `MultiPartParser`
- `FormParser`

You can modify parser classes by updating the API settings to include additional parsers or customize the existing ones to suit your project.


Each feature can be configured through the Django settings file. For further details, refer to the [Settings](#settings) section.

# Usage

This section provides a comprehensive guide on how to utilize the package's key features, including the functionality of the Django admin panels for managing notifications and deleted notifications, and queryset methods for handling notifications.

## Admin Site

If you are using a **custom admin site** in your project, you must pass your custom admin site configuration in your Django settings. Otherwise, Django may raise the following error during checks:

```shell
ERRORS:
<class 'django_notification.admin.deleted_notification.DeletedNotificationAdmin'>:
 (admin.E039) An admin for model "User" has to be registered to be referenced by DeletedNotificationAdmin.autocomplete_fields.
```
To resolve this, In your `settings.py`, add the following setting to specify the path to your custom admin site class instance:
```python
DJANGO_NOTIFICATION_ADMIN_SITE_CLASS = "path.to.your.custom.site"
```
example of a custom Admin Site:
```python
from django.contrib.admin import AdminSite

class CustomAdminSite(AdminSite):
    site_header = "Custom Admin"
    site_title = "Custom Admin Portal"
    index_title = "Welcome to the Custom Admin Portal"

# Instantiate the custom admin site as example
example_admin_site = CustomAdminSite(name='custom_admin')
```
and then reference the instance like this:

```python
DJANGO_NOTIFICATION_ADMIN_SITE_CLASS = "path.to.example_admin_site"
```
This setup allows `dj-notification-api` to use your custom admin site for it's Admin interface, preventing any errors and ensuring a smooth integration with the custom admin interface.

## Notifications Admin Panel

The `NotificationAdmin` class provides a comprehensive admin interface for managing notifications in the Django admin panel. The features and functionality are described below:

### Admin Actions

- **Mark as Sent**:

  An admin action that allows you to mark selected notifications as sent. When this action is performed, the `is_sent` field of the selected notifications will be updated to `True`. After execution, the admin will receive feedback indicating how many notifications were successfully updated.

### Inline Admin Interfaces

The `NotificationAdmin` panel includes two inline admin interfaces that allow admins to view and manage related models directly from the notification page:

- **NotificationRecipientInline**:

  Displays and manages the recipients associated with each notification. Admins can view or add recipient information directly within the notification details page.

- **NotificationSeenInline**:

  Displays and manages the records of when notifications were seen by recipients. This provides visibility into which recipients have already viewed the notification.

### List Display

The list view for notifications includes the following fields:

- `ID`: The unique identifier for each notification.
- `Title`: The notification title or a summary.
- Sent Status (`is_sent`): Indicates whether the notification has been sent.
- `Public` Status: Indicates if the notification is public.
- `Timestamp`: The time when the notification was created.

This view helps admins get a quick overview of the notifications and their current status.

### Filtering

Admins can filter the list of notifications based on the following fields:

- `is_sent`: Filter by whether the notification has been sent or not.
- `public`: Filter by whether the notification is public or private.
- `timestamp`: Filter by the creation time of the notification.

These filters make it easier to find specific notifications or groups of notifications based on status or time.

### Search Functionality

Admins can search for notifications using the following fields:

- `ID`: The unique identifier of the notification.
- `Recipient Username`: The username of the recipient associated with the notification.
- `Group Name`: The name of the group associated with the notification.

This search functionality enables quick access to specific notifications by key identifiers.

### Pagination

The admin list view displays **10 notifications per page** by default. This can help improve load times and make it easier for admins to manage large lists of notifications.

### Permissions Configuration

The admin permissions for `add`, `change`, and `delete` actions can be controlled through the following Django settings:

- `DJANGO_NOTIFICATION_ADMIN_HAS_ADD_PERMISSION`: Controls whether the "add" action is available in the Notifications and Deleted Notifications Admin. Defaults to `False`.

- `DJANGO_NOTIFICATION_ADMIN_HAS_CHANGE_PERMISSION`: Controls whether the "change" action is allowed in the Notifications and Deleted Notifications Admin. Defaults to `False`.

- `DJANGO_NOTIFICATION_ADMIN_HAS_DELETE_PERMISSION`: Controls whether the "delete" action is available in the Notifications and Deleted Notifications Admin. Defaults to `False`.



## Deleted Notifications Admin Panel

The Deleted Notifications Admin interface allows admins to manage notifications that have been marked as deleted. Admins can view, filter, and search through deleted notifications to ensure better tracking and management.

### Key Features

- **Autocomplete Fields**:

  - Autocomplete is available for the `notification` and `user` fields to facilitate quick selection.

- **List Display**:

  The admin interface shows the following fields in the list view:

  - `Notification ID`: The ID of the deleted notification.
  - `Title`: The title of the deleted notification.
  - `Deleted by`: The username of the user who deleted the notification.
  - `Deleted at`: The timestamp indicating when the notification was deleted.

- **List Filters**:

  - The admin interface allows filtering by the `deleted_at` timestamp, making it easy to view notifications deleted within specific time periods.

- **Pagination**:

  - By default, the list view displays **10 deleted notifications per page**, improving the performance of the admin interface when dealing with large numbers of entries.

### Search Functionality

Admins can search for deleted notifications using the following fields:

- `Notification ID`: Search by the unique identifier of the deleted notification.
- `Username`: Search by the username of the user who deleted the notification.

### Search Logic

Users can perform searching based on the following functionality:

- **Notification ID Search**: If the search term is a number, searches by the notification ID.
- **Username Search**: If the search term is a string, filters based on the username of the user who deleted the notification.

### Create a Notification

The `create_notification` method provides a convenient way to generate and store notifications in your Django application. This method is part of the `Notification` model and is used to create notifications with various attributes. Below is an overview of how to use this method effectively:

**Method Signature**

```shell
from django_notification.models.notification import Notification

Notification.objects.create_notification(
    verb,
    actor,
    description,
    recipients,
    groups,
    status,
    public,
    target,
    action_object,
    link,
    is_sent,
    data
)
```

**Arguments:**

- **verb** (`str`): A description of the action (e.g., "Logged in", "Created an item").
- **actor** (`Model`): The model instance that performs the action (e.g., user, system).
- **description** (`Optional[str]`): Optional additional information.

- **action_object** (`Optional[Model]`): Optional object that is the focus of the action.
- **link** (`Optional[str]`): Optional URL link related to the notification.
- **is_sent** (`bool`): Marks whether the notification is sent (default is `False`).
- **data** (`Optional[Dict]`): Optional additional data in dictionary format (JSON Field).

**Returns:**

- Created notification instance.

**Example Usage**

Here's an example of how to use the `create_notification` method to generate a notification:

```python
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
from django_notification.models.notification import Notification
from django_notification.models.helper.enums.status_choices import NotificationStatus

# Example data
actor = User.objects.get(username='john_doe')
recipients = [User.objects.get(username='jane_doe')]
description = "John Doe logged in to the admin panel."

# Creating a notification
notification = Notification.objects.create_notification(
    verb="Logged in to admin panel",
    actor=actor,
    description=description,
    recipients=recipients,
    status=NotificationStatus.INFO,
    public=True,
    link="http://example.com/admin",
    is_sent=True
)
```

**Note**: The `description` field is used as the title of the notification, which includes a time since the action occurred (e.g., "User logged in to admin area a minute ago."). If not provided, a default title will be generated based on the actor, verb, and other fields.


### Update a Notification

This method updates some editable fields of a notification by its ID.

**Method Signature**

```shell
Notification.objects.update_notification(
    notification_id,
    is_sent=None,
    public=None,
    data=None
)
```

**Arguments:**

  The updated sent status of the notification.

- **public** (`bool`):
  The updated public status of the notification.

- **data** (`Optional[JSONField]`):
  Optional additional data to store with the notification.

**Returns:**

- None.


### Delete a Notification

This method deletes a notification by its ID. If `soft_delete` is `True`, it moves the notification to the `DeletedNotifications` model; otherwise, it removes the notification instance (requires admin role).

**Method Signature**

```shell
Notification.objects.delete_notification(
    notification_id,
    recipient=None,
    soft_delete=True
) -> None
```

**Arguments:**

- **notification_id** (`int`):
  The ID of the notification to delete.

- **recipient** (`Optional[UserModel]`):
  Optional user instance to filter the notification by recipient.

- **soft_delete** (`bool`):
  If `True`, the notification is soft-deleted (moved to `DeletedNotifications`). If `False`, the notification is permanently deleted (requires admin role).

**Returns:**

- None.
