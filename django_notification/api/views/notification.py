    """API ViewSet for managing notifications.

    This viewset provides an interface for viewing and interacting with notifications.
    It allows users to list unseen notifications, mark notifications as seen, and
    retrieve detailed information about specific notifications. Depending on the
    user's role (staff or regular user), different levels of notification detail are provided.

    Features:
    - List Notifications: Retrieves a list of unseen notifications. The availability
      of this method is controlled by settings.
    - Retrieve Notification: Fetch detailed information about a specific notification
      by its ID. Mark the notification as seen upon retrieval. The availability of this
      method is controlled by settings.
    - Mark All as Seen: Marks all unseen notifications for the user as seen.

    Customizations:
    - Dynamic Serializer: Depending on the user's role or configuration settings,
      the viewset selects between `NotificationSerializer` for detailed information
      and `SimpleNotificationSerializer` for basic notification data.
    - Filtering and Searching: Supports filtering, searching, and ordering through
      Django filters (`DjangoFilterBackend`, `SearchFilter`, `OrderingFilter`).
    - Configuration via Settings: Additional functionality and attributes, such as
      method availability and serializer details, are configured through project settings
      and dynamically applied in the `configure_attrs` method.

    Parsers:
    - Accepts various content types, such as `application/json` and `multipart/form-data`,
      allowing flexibility in handling requests that include file uploads or JSON payloads.

    Methods:
    - `GET /notifications/`: List unseen notifications.
    - `GET /notifications/<id>/`: Retrieve detailed information about a specific notification.
    - `GET /notifications/mark_all_as_seen/`: Mark all unseen notifications as seen.

    Permissions:
    - Only users with proper permissions are allowed to interact with the notifications.
    - Staff users have access to more detailed views and additional features.

    Settings:
    - The availability of list and retrieve methods is determined by the configuration
      (`DJANGO_NOTIFICATION_API_ALLOW_LIST`, `DJANGO_NOTIFICATION_API_ALLOW_RETRIEVE`).
    - The level of notification details returned is based on the user's role and the setting
      (`DJANGO_NOTIFICATION_SERIALIZER_INCLUDE_FULL_DETAILS`).

    Parsers and filters are automatically applied based on the request's `Content-Type`
    and query parameters, making the viewset flexible and adaptable to various use cases.
