    """API ViewSet for managing and interacting with user activities
    (notifications).

    This viewset allows users to view, clear, and delete their seen activities.
    The functionality provided depends on user roles and configuration settings,
    such as soft and hard deletion of notifications.

    Features:
    - List Activities: Lists all seen notifications for the user. The availability of
      this method is controlled by settings.
    - Retrieve Activity: Retrieve detailed information about a specific notification
      by its ID. The availability of this method is controlled by settings.
    - Clear Activities: Allows users to soft-delete or clear all notifications. This
      functionality is controlled by settings.
    - Delete Activities: Admin users can permanently delete notifications. This
      feature is controlled by settings.

    Customizations:
    - Dynamic Serializer: Based on user role and settings, the appropriate serializer
      is chosen between `NotificationSerializer` (for detailed information) and
      `SimpleNotificationSerializer` (for basic information).
    - Conditional Actions: Soft and hard deletion actions are conditionally enabled
      based on settings and permissions.
      Admins have additional capabilities such as hard-deleting notifications based on settings.
    - Filtering and Searching: This view supports filtering, searching, and ordering
      of notifications via `DjangoFilterBackend`, `SearchFilter`, and `OrderingFilter`.
    - Configuration via Settings: The viewset is dynamically configured using the
      `configure_attrs` method, which adjusts method availability and functionality
      based on project settings.

    Parsers:
    - Accepts various content types, such as `application/json` and `multipart/form-data`,
      allowing flexibility in handling requests that include file uploads or JSON payloads.

    Methods:
    - `GET /activities/`: List all seen notifications.
    - `GET /activities/<id>/`: Retrieve detailed information about a specific notification.
    - `GET /activities/clear_activities/`: Soft-delete or clear all activities (conditionally enabled).
    - `GET /activities/<id>/clear_notification/`: Soft-delete a specific notification (conditionally enabled).
    - `GET /activities/delete_activities/`: Permanently delete all activities (admin only, conditionally enabled).
    - `GET /activities/<id>/delete_notification`: Permanently delete a specific notification (admin only, conditionally enabled).

    Permissions:
    - Regular Users: Can list, retrieve, and clear their own notifications.
    - Admin Users: Have additional permissions to hard-delete notifications, depending
      on the configuration.

    Settings:
    - The availability of list and retrieve methods is controlled by `DJANGO_NOTIFICATION_API_ALLOW_LIST`
      and `DJANGO_NOTIFICATION_API_ALLOW_RETRIEVE` settings.
    - The soft-delete and hard-delete functionalities are controlled by `DJANGO_NOTIFICATION_API_INCLUDE_SOFT_DELETE`
      and `DJANGO_NOTIFICATION_API_INCLUDE_HARD_DELETE` settings.
    - The level of notification details returned is based on the user's role and the setting
      (`DJANGO_NOTIFICATION_SERIALIZER_INCLUDE_FULL_DETAILS`).

    This viewset provides a flexible and configurable API for managing notification activities,
    with dynamic behavior driven by user roles and project settings.
